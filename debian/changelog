             opening up Perl subroutines to all configuration parsers, not
             just PropertyConfigurator. Configuration subs for cspecs,

             The previous, flawed implementation surfaced while using
             a 'trigger' category, reported by Olivier Bilodeau.

    + (ms) Added l4p-tmpl helper script to help whipping up a new
           log4perl configuration file.
    + (ms) Fixed uninitialized warning on XML configuration files,
           reported by jbkilian on the sourceforge mailing list.
    + (ms) Applied patch [RT 43426] by AFF <aff@cpan.org> to have
           appender_thresholds_adjust return number of appenders changed.
    + (ms) [RT 34400] New :nostrict target which allows redefining a
           category within a Log4perl configuration file without error
           or even a warning.
    + (ms) [RT 34401] Applied patch by Jae Gangemi, who fixed
           code references in @INC on Win32 systems.
    + (ms) [RT 32259] Patternlayout now supports %R, which returns the

           the current logging event (thanks to Emmanuel Rodriguez for
           the patch).
    + (ms) [RT 30899] Color configuration and attribute support

  * New upstream release
    +   (ms) DBI-1.608 removed a DBD::File 'feature' that allowed leaving

             bind parameters, or other execute() errors.
    +   (ms) Made DBI test suite more robust against preexisting conditions
    +   (ms) Added force_next_check() for init_and_watch(), cleaned up

    +   (ms) Fixed test suite to run on Strawberry Perl on Win32 (reported
             by kmx on https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45983)
    +   (ms) Added 'utf8' option to screen appender and easy mode, some of
             it suggested by Shantanu Bhadoria.
    +   (ms) is_xxx() returned true prior to L4p initialization. Fixed it
             and adapted test suite.
    +   (ms) Added test cases on syswrite in recreate mode
    +   (ms) Applied patch by Jens Berthold <log4perl@jebecs.de> to

liblog-log4perl-perl (1.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    *  (ms) If a conversion pattern was specified twice in a config
            file, the output was "ARRAY(0x804da00)" (bug reported by
            Bill Mason). Now, gobbling up property configurator values
            into an array is limited to appender properties and
            excludes the conversion pattern.
    *  (ms) Multiple calls to import (usually happens if 'use L4p' gets
            called twice within the same namespace) caused nasty warnings,
            bug reported by Greg Olszewski. Fixed by ignoring subsequent
            calls from the same package to import().
    *  (ms) Changed rendering of logdie/warn/cluck/croak/... messages
            to fix a bug reported by Martin J. Evans.
    *  (ms) Added a L4p::Appender::String appender to handle the
            rendering internally.
    *  (ms) Documentation patch by Matisse Enzer on increased/
            decreased log levels.

    * (ms) Fixed the bug with the caller level of the first
           log message sent after init_and_watch() detected a change. Added
           test case to 027Watch2.t.

    * (ms) Fix to L4p::Util::module::available() for Win32
           compliance by Roger Yager <roger.yager@eyestreet.com>
    * (ms) Added check to L4p::Util::module_available() returning true

           already been loaded. This fixes a problem when running L4p

liblog-log4perl-perl (0.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Excerpted changes:
    * (ms) Added ':resurrect' source filter, which uncomments all lines
           starting with "###l4p". Can be used for hidden L4p statements,
           which are then activated by calling
           'use Log::Log4perl qw(:resurrect)'.
    * (ms) Fixed Win32 test suite bug: File::Spec->catfile() returns '/'
           as a path separator on both Unix and Win32, while Log4perl's
           layouts (derived from caller() info) use '\' on Win32 and '/'
           on Unix. Changed tests to only verify file name, not path.
    * (ms) Added 'appender_by_name()' to retrieve an appender defined
           in the configuration file by name later.
    * (ms) Added FAQ on "stubbing out" L4p macros in environments
           that don't have L4p installed.
    * (ms) Added convenience function appender_thresholds_adjust() to adjust
           thresholds of chosen (or all) appenders
    * (ms) Got rid of Test::Simple dependency
    * (ms) Moved autoflush setting in L4p::Appender::File from log()
           to file_open(), running only once, not with every message.
    * (ms) Applied doc fixes suggested by Jon Bjornstad.
    * (ms) Added ScreenANSIColor appender to colorize messages based on
           their priority. See Log::Log4perl::Appender::ScreenANSIColor.

           reloads the last working config.
    * (ms) init() now also accepts an open file handle (passed in as a

    * (ms) Jos I. Boumans <kane@xs4all.net> and

liblog-log4perl-perl (0.48-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Excerpted changes:
    * (ms) fixed bug reported by Chip Salzenberg <chip@pobox.com>: logdie()
           and logwarn() are now compliant with the warn() and die()
           standard which suppresses the "at file line x" message if
           the message ends with a "\n".
    * (ms) New interface for custom config parsers.
           Log::Log4perl::Config::BaseConfigurator now provides a base class
           for new config parsers. Init can now be called like
           Log::Log4perl->init($parser) with a parser object, which is
           derived from Log::Log4perl::Config::BaseConfigurator and
           provides a parse() method (no arguments). The file (or whatever)
           to be parsed can be set by calling $parser->text(\@lines) or
           $parser->file($name) before calling L4p->init($parser).
           The Property, DOM and LDAP configurators have been
           adapted, check their implementation for details.
    * (ms) Added integrity check for Log4perl configurations: Log4perl
           now issues a warning if a configuration doesn't define any
           appenders. Should anyone not like this, it can be turned
           off by setting $L4p::Config::CONFIG_INTEGRITY_CHECK = 0
           before calling init().
    * (ms) Fixed bug reported by Johannes Kilian <jok@vitronic.com>
           with __DIE__ handler and "PatternLayout" shortcut. Replaced
           'eval { require ... }' by L4p::Util::module_available in
           L4p::Config.pm.
    * (ms) Did away with $IS_LOADED internal variable.
    * (ms) Fixed bug with L4p::INITIALIZED vs. L4P::Logger::INITIALIZED,
           added t/020Easy2.t.
    * (ms) Added adm/cvskwexp script to check if we're running into CVS

            "silent_recovery" will silently ignore errors and recover
            if possible on initiallly dead socket connections.
     * (ms) Fixed bug with initialized() -- checking once caused
            subsequent calls to return true.
     * (ms) run t/045Composite.t only if Storable is installed -- earlier
            perl versions (like 5.6.1) don't have it by default.
     * (ms) fixed test case in t/020Easy.t for buggy perl 5.6.1
     * (ms) added Log::Log4perl::infiltrate_lwp() to make LWP::UserAgent
            play in the L4p framework upon request.
     * (ms) perl 5.00503 mysteriously core dumps in t/017Watch.t, seems like
            this was introduced in 0.46. Disabled these tests for now
            if we're on 5.00503 to avoid installation hickups. Longer term,
            need to investigate.

     * (kg) added filters to XML DOMConfig and DTD
     * (ms) Fixed caller level to cspecs by adding one
     * (ms) Added init_once() and documentation
     * (ms) Worked around the perl bug that triggers __DIE__ handlers
            even if die() occurs within an eval(). So if you did
              BEGIN { $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { print "ouch!"; die }; }
              use Log::Log4perl;
            and Time::HiRes wasn't available, the
              eval { require Time::HiRes }
            in PatternLayout.pm triggered the __DIE__ handler. Now there's
            a function module_available() in L4p::Util to check if a
            module is installed.
     * (ms) Fixed %M cspec in PatternLayout in case a logging
            method is called within one (or more) eval {} block(s).
            caller(n+m) will be called repeatedly if necessary
            to get the next real subroutine. Anonymous subroutines will
            still be called __ANON__, but this can be overridden by
            defining
                local *__ANON__ = "subroutine_name";

      Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized, an appender guaranteeing
      atomic logging of messages via semaphores.
    * (ms) Added basic substitution to PropertyConfigurator. Now you can
      define variables (like in "name=value") and subsequent patterns
      of "${name}" will be replaced by "value" in the configuration file.
    * (kg) Followed Mike's lead and added variable substitution to the
      DOMConfigurator.
    * (ms) Added Log::Log4perl::Appender::Socket as a simple Socket
      appender featuring connection recovery.

      Brett Rann <brettrann@mail.com>.
    * (ms) Added signal handling to init_and_watch
    * (ms) renamed l4p-internal DEBUG constant to avoid confusion with
